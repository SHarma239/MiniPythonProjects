#Imports
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

toappend = ""
url = 'http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/textmessageabbreviations.asp'

# Creating the Beautiful Soup object
source_code = requests.get(url)
html_text = source_code.text
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_text)
soup = soup.table.tbody

#Iterating to get to the desired element
for link in soup.findAll('tr'):
    for abbr in link.findAll('td'):
        for txt in abbr.findAll('p'):
            toappend+=txt.text+" - "
    toappend = toappend[:-2]
    toappend+="\n"

# Saving the data to a file for further processing
abbreviations = open("chatacronyms.txt",'w')
abbreviations.write(toappend.encode('utf-8').strip())
abbreviations.close()

# One or two elements had to be fixed manually for the program to work correctly. Use the chatacronyms.txt file to get the correct results. 
#This scraper is going to generate chatacronyms.txt which will have most of the data
